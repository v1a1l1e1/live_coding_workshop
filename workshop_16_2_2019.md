>Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is getting somewhere interesting. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for your pleasure.



> Live coding works across musical genres, and has been seen in concert halls, late night jazz bars, as well as algoraves. There is also a strong movement of video-based live coders, writing code to make visuals, and many environments can do both sound and video, creating synaesthetic experiences.


>Live coding refers to the creation and modification of algorithms with a creative purpose in real time often in the presence of a **physical or virtual audience**. The community is diverse and seeks to engage in a wide cross-section of artistic practices including but not limited to music, audiovisual creation, performance, robotics, dance, scientific research and education.



>Live coding is inclusive and accessible to all.


>Live coding is primarily developed inside the **free culture movement**, and **encourages self creativity rather than cultural consumption.** Also diversity inclusion and respect has always been considered a fundamental part of the thinking around this practice in live coding communities.

## Algorave

[algorave logo]()

Algorave is made from “sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive conditionals“.


This is no new idea, but Algoraves focus on humans making and dancing to music. Algorave musicians don’t pretend their software is being creative, they take responsibility for the music they make, shaping it using whatever means they have.


The focus is not on what the musician is doing, but on the music, and people dancing to it.
Algoraves embrace the alien sounds of raves from the past, and introduce alien, futuristic rhythms and beats made through strange, algorithm-aided processes. It’s up to the good people on the dancefloor to help the musicians make sense of this and do the real creative work in making a great party.
